// Js is a case sensitive language i.e Iago is different from iAgo e.g

var Campala = " A Campala is a style of clothing";

var campala; // now a campala with a different case C

console.log(campala); //undefined. Because nothing was assigned to the campala with a lower c

console.log(Campala); // A Campala is a style of clothing
